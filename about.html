            <p>Hello! 👋</p>

            <p>I am Yatima, I was born in Italy but my family tree goes back to South America.</p>

            <p>I started playing with computers since I was 3 years old and years later one day I bought a computers magazine that shipped a software called <em>"The Games Factory"</em> and as you can imagine I started tinkering around with game engines ever since!</p>

            <p>Decided to study some Computer Science in Italy but there were no 3D engines courses available so I decided to delve deeper by myself into how 2D and 3D engines work and studied more the 3D graphics rendering side of things while also working for some nearby startups.</p>

            <p>Very cool stuff and after a while ended up landing a job in big companies, but this is the boring work experience stuff, you can find out about my professional life in my <a href="cv.html">CV</a>.</p>

            <p>I really like playing Dungeon & Dragons so if you use Roll20 send me a message!</p>

            <p>I also tinker around with home automation stuff (KNX, Raspberry Pi & Home Assistant).</p>

            <p>At home I have MikroTik devices because that's how you do a nice network 😎 (If you need any help contact me!)</p>

            <p>As anime I really enjoy One Piece! 🏴‍☠️</p>

            <p>And as always I'm very excited about the crypto space and RISC hardware.</p>
