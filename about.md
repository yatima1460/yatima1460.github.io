Hello! 👋

I am Yatima, I was born in Italy but my family tree goes back to South America.

I started playing with computers since I was 3 years old and years later one day I bought a computers magazine that shipped a software called _"The Games Factory"_ and as you can imagine I started tinkering around with game engines ever since!

Decided to study some Computer Science in Italy but there were no 3D engines courses available so I decided to delve deeper by myself into how 2D and 3D engines work and studied more the 3D graphics rendering side of things while also working for some nearby startups.

Very cool stuff and after a while ended up landing a job in big companies, but this is the boring work experience stuff, you can find out about my professional life in my [CV]({{ site.url }}/{{ site.resume-url }}).

I really like playing Dungeon & Dragons so if you use Roll20 send me a message!

I also tinker around with home automation stuff (KNX, Raspberry Pi & Home Assistant).

At home I have MikroTik devices because that's how you do a nice network 😎 (If you need any help contact me!)

As anime I really enjoy One Piece! 🏴‍☠️

And as always I'm very excited about the crypto space and RISC hardware.
