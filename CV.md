I developed for a startup called Sfera Productions: VR virtual tours, experiences, documentaries, and video games; with a small team
using various early-market headsets such as Oculus DK2, HTC Vive, Samsung Gear, Cardboard,

We utilized Unreal Engine 4.x as our development engine.
One notable collaboration was with Cranio Creations, an Italian board game manufacturer, where
we digitized a tabletop board game to run within Unreal with VR controllers.

We showcased multiple VR video games and experiences at Lucca Comics & Games, one of
Europe's largest comic-cons, where we had our own stand.
Additionally, I contributed to the publication of a video game on Steam.

Alongside occasional C++ programming, my main focus was on performance optimizations.

As we were running VR simulations on hardware not specifically designed for virtual reality, including
